Battleship Game using Python:

  In this project I have built a simplified, one-player version of the classic board game Battleship! 
In this version of the game, there will be a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. 
The player will have 4 guesses to try to sink the ship.
To build this game I have used knowledge of lists, conditionals and functions in Python. 

Further improvemets will be made in the game with time.
